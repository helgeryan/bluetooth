# Bluetooth Example App - Ryan Helgeson

## Description
Example app used to display ability to implement the CoreBluetooth framework provided by Apple.

### UI/UX Design
Built in SwiftUI and incorporates a Home page where a user can scan for a list of devices and select a device to open it in detail. A spinner will show to denote that the app is scanning for devices. The details page then allows for a user to attempt to connect to the device. If an error occurs at any point the app will show an error notification for 5 seconds on the home screen explaining what has occured to the user.
